    <h1>Star System Generator for GURPS 4<sup>th</sup> Edition</h1>
	<div id="welcome-text">
        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
		<p>This is a little tool to generate star systems for use in any story or Pen &amp; Paper roleplaying game. <br/>
		We use the rules from <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/space/" target="_blank">GURPS Space</a> in the background and generate some stats that are of use in GURPS Space games.</p>
		<p>The majority of the information is not game-specific, however, and is useful to anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <form id="generation" action="starsystem">
        <h3>Generate a star system:</h3>

        <p>You can select some options about the star system, or leave it completely random. <input id="generate" type="submit" value="Generate star system"/></p>
        <hr />
        <div class="customization_legend">
            <p>
                The rules often generate hostile systems, as habitable, garden-type worlds are fairly rare. If you need to generate a system with such a world, it is preferable to force it. <br/>
                Note that even a garden-type world may be very cold or hot, as long as it falls in a range that humans can live in! <br/>
                If you want your star system to be located in an open cluster (which makes for close neighboring systems to explore) check the box. <br/>
                You can also choose to force a specific number of stars, although only 1 to 3 are possible, with 0 representing random choice.
