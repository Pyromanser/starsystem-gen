        <h4>Welcome!</h4>
		<p>This is a little tool to generate star systems for use in any story or Pen \& Paper roleplaying game. <br/>
		We use the rules from <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/space/" target="_blank">GURPS Space</a> in the background and generate some stats that are of use in GURPS Space games.</p>
		<p>The majority of the information is not game-specific, however, and is useful to anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <form id="generation" action="starsystem">
		You can select some options about the star system, or leave it completely random. <br/>
        Force star system with garden world? <input id="garden" type="checkbox" name="must_have_garden" value="True" /> <br/>
        Should the star system be an open cluster? <input id="opencluster" type="checkbox" name="opencluster" value="True" /> <br/>
        Do you want to force a specific number of stars? 1-3 are possible, other values are treated as random. <input id="numstars" type="number" name="numstars" /> <br/>
        <input id="generate" type="submit" value="Generate star system"/>
