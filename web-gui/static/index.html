    <h1>Star System Generator for GURPS 4<sup>th</sup> Edition</h1>
	<div id="welcome-text">
        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
		<p>This is a little tool to generate star systems for use in any story or Pen &amp; Paper roleplaying game. <br/>
		We use the rules from <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/space/" target="_blank">GURPS Space</a> in the background and generate some stats that are of use in GURPS Space games.</p>
		<p>The majority of the information is not game-specific, however, and is useful to anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <form id="generation" action="starsystem">
        <h3>Customization Options</h3>
        <p>
        You can select some options about the star system, or leave it completely random. <br />
            The rules often generate hostile systems, as garden-type worlds are fairly rare. If you need to generate a system with such a world, it is preferable to force it.
            Note that even a garden-type world may be very cold or hot, as long as it falls in a range that humans can live in! <br />
            If you want your star system to be located in an open cluster (which makes for close neighboring systems to explore) check the box. <br />
            You can also choose to force a specific number of stars, values 1-3 are possible (other values are ignored).
        </p>
        <hr />
        <input id="garden" type="checkbox" name="must_have_garden" value="True" /> Force garden world <br/>
        <input id="open_cluster" type="checkbox" name="open_cluster" value="True" /> Location: Open cluster <br/>
        <input id="num_stars" type="number" name="num_stars" /> Number of stars in the system <br/>
