	<div id="welcome-text">
        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
		<p>This is a little tool to generate star systems for use in any story or Pen &amp; Paper roleplaying game. <br/>
		We use the rules from <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/space/" target="_blank">GURPS Space</a> in the background and generate some stats that are of use in GURPS Space games.</p>
		<p>The majority of the information is not game-specific, however, and is useful to anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <form id="generation" action="starsystem">
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <p>
            You can select some options about the star system, or leave it completely random.
            The rules often generate hostile systems, as garden-type worlds are fairly rare. If you need to generate a system with such a world, it is preferable to force it.
            Note that even a garden-type world may be very cold or hot, as long as it falls in a range that humans can live in!
        </p>
        Force star system with garden world? <input id="garden" type="checkbox" name="must_have_garden" value="True" /> <br/>
        Should the star system be in an open cluster? <input id="open_cluster" type="checkbox" name="open_cluster" value="True" /> <br/>
        Do you want to force a specific number of stars? 1-3 are possible, other values are treated as random. <input id="num_stars" type="number" name="num_stars" /> <br/>
        <input id="generate" type="submit" value="Generate star system"/>
